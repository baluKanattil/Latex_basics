\section*{Tutorial 1}
This is my first LaTeX document.

Suppose we are given a rectangle with side lengths $(x+1)$ and $(x+3)$. Then the equation A=$x^2 + 4x+3$ represents the area of the rectangle.

\section*{Explanation}
The documents starts with document class. We can have letter size 10,11 and 12 pts. Mostly document type will be article. Next begin the document. Type in the body. There are two modes -

1. Text mode: Normal Mode

2. Math mode: Starts and ends with dollar sign. It can be inline or display mode(double dollar)

The return can be hard return or soft return. But soft return cause indentation.
